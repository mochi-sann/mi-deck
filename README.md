## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: >= 25
- **pnpm**: >= 10
- **Docker**: (Optional) Required for running a local Misskey instance.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mochi-sann/mi-deck.git
cd mi-deck
pnpm install
```

### Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to set up your environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`).

### Running Local Backend

To start a local instance of Misskey (along with PostgreSQL and Redis) for development:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will launch a Misskey server at `http://localhost:3002`.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will typically launch the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building

To build the application and packages for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Deployment

The project is configured for deployment to **Cloudflare Pages** via `wrangler`.
